> ## ⚠️  Authorized Testing Only
>
> **Mantis is offensive-security tooling. Use it only against systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test.**
>
> - Running Mantis against systems without permission is illegal in most jurisdictions.
> - Mantis enforces scope cryptographically at the egress proxy, but the **legal gate is yours**.
> - The CLI refuses to start without `--i-have-authorization`. Passing that flag is a self-attestation, not a legal credential.
> - See [Responsible Use](docs/site/responsible-use.md) for the full policy.

Daemon-driven, evidence-grade automated security research platform.

Mantis plans, executes, verifies, and reports authorized offensive-security
engagements with cryptographically-verifiable provenance. It writes working
exploits, runs continuously against in-scope assets, and improves
measurably between engagements through learned playbooks, evolutionary
self-tuning, and a self-generated training corpus.

## Install

**Via npm / bun / yarn / pnpm** (recommended, one platform binary auto-selected):

```sh
npm  install -g mantishack
bun  add    -g mantishack
yarn global add mantishack
pnpm add    -g mantishack
```

**Or one-line from source:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deonmenezes/mantishack/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer:
1. Builds `mantis-daemon` and `mantis` (release) into `~/.local/bin`.
2. Detects which AI CLI(s) you have installed and copies the matching
   plugin into the CLI's plugin directory:

   | CLI | Detection | Plugin dir |
   |---|---|---|
   | Claude Code | `claude` on PATH or `~/.claude/` | `~/.claude/plugins/mantis/` |
   | Codex CLI   | `codex` on PATH or `~/.codex/` | `~/.codex/plugins/mantis/` |
   | OpenCode    | `opencode` on PATH or `~/.config/opencode/` | `~/.config/opencode/plugins/mantis/` |

After install you can drive Mantis from any of those CLIs:

```
/mantishack <target>       one-shot end-to-end pentest (every step in one command)
/mantis-scan <target>      kick off an authorized engagement
/mantis-status [id]        engagement status
/mantis-claim <id>         inspect a verified finding
/mantis-report <id>        render a disclosure-ready report
/mantis-daemon             start/stop the daemon
```

`/mantishack` accepts:
- web URL: `https://example.com`
- domain: `example.com`
- Android: `app.apk`
- iOS: `app.ipa`
- Windows: `app.exe`
- macOS: `app.dmg` / `app.app`
- API: any URL pointing at an OpenAPI spec or REST endpoint

Embedded URLs are extracted from packaged-app binaries via
`strings` and pentest-routed through the same web pipeline.

### Don't have an AI CLI yet?

```sh
# Claude Code
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Codex CLI (OpenAI)
npm install -g @openai/codex

# OpenCode
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

Then rerun the Mantis installer to wire the plugin in.

## Standalone usage (no AI CLI)

```sh
mantis-daemon &                                    # start the daemon
mantis engagement create "demo" --target https://x # create an engagement
mantis engagement start "demo"                     # begin scanning
mantis engagement status "demo" --watch            # live status
mantis engagement report "demo" --format pdf       # render report
```

## Requirements

- One supported host CLI: Claude Code, Codex, or another MCP-capable host — required for the slash-command surface (`/mantishack`, etc.). The standalone CLI (`mantis hack`, `mantis pentest`) has no AI-CLI dependency.
- A working Rust toolchain — only for source builds. The prebuilt npm binary has no deps.

Recon tools (subfinder, httpx, katana, nuclei, jwt_tool) are **auto-installed** into the per-repo `tools/recon/bin/` directory by `install.sh` / `mantis init`. No manual `go install` step needed; the recon-agent prepends that directory to PATH at engagement start. Run `mantis doctor` to confirm what's installed. Mantis runs without any of them — coverage just narrows.

## Attributions

Mantis takes architectural inspiration from open-source projects in the offensive-security space. See [`NOTICE`](./NOTICE) for the full list — covers [Hacker Bob](https://github.com/vmihalis/hacker-bob) (the MCP-tool-orchestrated workflow + wave/handoff pattern), [ProjectDiscovery](https://github.com/projectdiscovery) (recon binaries: subfinder, httpx, katana, nuclei), [ticarpi/jwt_tool](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool), and [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3). Per-binary licenses + install-time-fetch vs vendoring rationale live in [`tools/recon/THIRD_PARTY.md`](./tools/recon/THIRD_PARTY.md). All Rust code in this repo is original; the third-party projects are credited as inspiration or invoked as separate subprocesses.

The security-critical crate is `mantis-egress` — it is the single network
boundary. All HTTP traffic from any other component routes through it.
This is enforced at the proxy socket layer, not advisorially.

## Deployment

`deploy/` contains templates for the five §14 deployment modes:

- `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`             — multi-stage build, non-root runtime
- `deploy/systemd/mantis-daemon.service` — hardened systemd unit for VPS
- `deploy/k8s/mantis-deployment.yaml`    — Kubernetes Deployment + RBAC + PVC
- `deploy/modal/mantis_modal.py`         — hibernating serverless on Modal

See `deploy/README.md` for the install commands per mode.

## Authorization

Mantis runs **only against assets you are explicitly authorized to test**.
Every engagement requires a signed scope manifest. The plugin slash
commands re-verify the user has authorization before running any scan.
