//! Exploit primitives.
//!
//! A [`Primitive`] takes a discovered [`Surface`] and runs a single
//! targeted check against it, returning a [`PrimitiveResult`] that is
//! one of:
//!
//! - [`PrimitiveResult::Confirmed`] — the issue is present, with
//!   evidence and a reproducer.
//! - [`PrimitiveResult::Denied`] — the check explicitly rules the
//!   issue out.
//! - [`PrimitiveResult::Inconclusive`] — the check could not decide,
//!   with a reason (network failure, unexpected response shape).
//!
//! Every primitive must produce a [`Reproducer`] when the verdict is
//! Confirmed. The reproducer is the artifact the operator hands to a
//! disclosure program. Currently the reproducer ships in two
//! dialects (cURL one-liner + raw HTTP); Phase 1 will add Python,
//! Burp/Caido, and Rust dialects per PRD §5.7.10.
