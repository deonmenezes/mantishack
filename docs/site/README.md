## What is Mantis?

Mantis is a Rust daemon plus a Claude-Code-native MCP agent workflow that plans, executes, verifies, and reports authorized offensive-security engagements with **cryptographically-verifiable provenance**.

- **7-phase FSM** — every engagement walks `RECON → AUTH → HUNT → CHAIN → VERIFY → GRADE → REPORT`.
- **Parallel hunter sub-agents** — wave fan-out across attack surfaces; ≥3 hunters per wave even on a 1-surface target.
- **3-round verifier cascade** — brutalist (skeptic) → balanced (false-negative catcher) → final (fresh re-run), with a deterministic `adjudication_plan_hash` gate that any drift hard-refuses.
- **Cryptographic scope enforcement** — every outbound HTTP request goes through `mantis-egress`, a CONNECT proxy that verifies the destination against a signed scope manifest.
- **Signed Merkle event log** — every state change is a BLAKE3 leaf in a per-engagement Merkle tree, signed by an Ed25519 workspace key. Operators verify post-hoc with `mantis-verify`.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Install
npm  install -g mantishack
# or: bun add -g mantishack

# 2. Wire the daemon + MCP server
mantis init

# 3. Run an end-to-end pentest against an authorized target
mantis hack app.example.com --i-have-authorization
```

That single `mantis hack` invocation drives the full 7-phase FSM end-to-end, with parallel hunter sub-agents during HUNT, the 3-round verifier cascade, evidence packaging, grading, and report rendering.
