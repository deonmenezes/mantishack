# MANTISHACK Dataflow Validation - Implementation Summary

## Mission: Separate Real Vulnerabilities from False Positives

Dataflow validation is the **CRITICAL** step that determines if a CodeQL finding is actually exploitable or just a false positive. This is the hardest and most valuable part of automated security analysis.

## What is Dataflow Validation?

After CodeQL detects a potential vulnerability with a complete dataflow path (source → sink), we use an LLM to perform **deep validation** by analyzing:

1. **Source Control**: Is the source actually attacker-controlled?
2. **Sanitizer Effectiveness**: Do sanitizers in the path truly prevent exploitation?
3. **Bypass Techniques**: Can sanitizers be circumvented?
4. **Reachability**: Can an attacker actually trigger this code path?
5. **Attack Complexity**: How difficult is exploitation?

## Implementation Details

### Phase 4: Dataflow Validation

**File:** `packages/llm_analysis/agent.py` - `validate_dataflow()` method

### Key Components

#### 1. Validation Trigger

Dataflow validation is performed automatically for vulnerabilities that meet ALL criteria:
- ✅ Has complete dataflow path (source, sink, intermediate steps)
- ✅ Initial LLM analysis marked as exploitable
- ✅ Dataflow was successfully extracted

```python
if vuln.has_dataflow and vuln.exploitable:
    logger.info("🔍 Performing DEEP DATAFLOW VALIDATION...")
    validation = self.validate_dataflow(vuln)
```

#### 2. Comprehensive Validation Prompt

The LLM receives:

**COMPLETE DATAFLOW PATH:**
```
SOURCE: (where tainted data enters)
- Location: File.java:15
- Type: request.getParameter("sql")
- Code: [actual code with context]

INTERMEDIATE STEPS:
 SANITIZER #1: input.trim()
- Location: Validator.java:42
- Code: [actual sanitization code]

 TRANSFORMATION #2: buildQuery(sql)
- Location: QueryBuilder.java:78
- Code: [actual transformation code]

SINK: (dangerous operation)
- Location: Database.java:156
- Type: executeQuery(sql)
- Code: [actual query execution]
```

**VALIDATION TASKS:**

1. **Source Control Analysis**
   - Is data from HTTP request/user input → ATTACKER CONTROLLED ✅
   - Is it from config file/env variable → REQUIRES ACCESS 🔶
   - Is it hardcoded constant → FALSE POSITIVE ❌

2. **Sanitizer Effectiveness Analysis**
   - What does each sanitizer do exactly?
   - Is it appropriate for the vulnerability type?
   - Can it be bypassed? (encoding, case sensitivity, incomplete filtering)
   - Is it applied to all code paths?

3. **Reachability Analysis**
   - Can attacker trigger this code path?
   - Are there auth/authz checks blocking access?
   - Are there prerequisites that prevent exploitation?

4. **Exploitability Assessment**
   - Can attacker-controlled data reach sink with malicious content?
   - What specific payload would work?
   - What's the attack complexity?

5. **Impact Analysis**
   - What can attacker achieve if exploited?
   - Estimate CVSS score

#### 3. Structured Validation Schema

The LLM provides structured output:

```json
{
  "source_type": "user_input|config|hardcoded|etc",
  "source_attacker_controlled": true/false,
  "source_reasoning": "detailed explanation",

  "sanitizers_found": 2,
  "sanitizers_effective": false,
  "sanitizer_details": [
    {
      "name": "input.trim()",
      "purpose": "remove whitespace",
      "bypass_possible": true,
      "bypass_method": "trim() doesn't prevent SQL injection..."
    }
  ],

  "path_reachable": true,
  "reachability_barriers": ["requires authentication"],

  "is_exploitable": true/false,
  "exploitability_confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "exploitability_reasoning": "detailed verdict",

  "attack_complexity": "low|medium|high",
  "attack_prerequisites": ["valid credentials", "..."],
  "attack_payload_concept": "payload description",

  "impact_if_exploited": "RCE, data theft, etc",
  "cvss_estimate": 9.8,

  "false_positive": true/false,
  "false_positive_reason": "why it's FP"
}
```

#### 4. Verdict Integration

Based on validation results, MANTISHACK automatically:

**IF FALSE POSITIVE:**
```python
vuln.exploitable = False
vuln.exploitability_score = 0.0
logger.info("⚠️ Validation marked as FALSE POSITIVE")
```

**IF NOT EXPLOITABLE:**
```python
vuln.exploitable = False
vuln.exploitability_score = confidence * 0.5
logger.info("⚠️ Validation determined NOT EXPLOITABLE")
```

**IF EXPLOITABLE:**
```python
vuln.exploitable = True  # Confirmed
vuln.exploitability_score = max(original_score, validation_confidence)
logger.info("✓ Validation confirms EXPLOITABLE")
```

#### 5. Validation Output

For each validated dataflow, MANTISHACK saves:

1. **Validation JSON**: `out/validation/{finding_id}_validation.json`
   - Complete validation assessment
   - Sanitizer bypass analysis
   - Attack payload concepts

2. **Integrated Analysis**: Validation merged into main analysis JSON
   ```json
   {
     "analysis": {
       ...original analysis...
       "dataflow_validation": {
         ...validation results...
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Validation Metrics

MANTISHACK tracks:
- **dataflow_validated**: Number of dataflow paths deep-validated
- **false_positives_caught**: False positives identified by validation
- **exploitability_confidence**: Refined exploitability scores

These appear in:
- Real-time logs during analysis
- Final Phase II summary
- JSON reports
- mantishack_agentic.py output

## Real-World Example

### Example 1: Weak Cryptography (FALSE POSITIVE)

**Initial Finding:**
```
Rule: java/weak-cryptographic-algorithm
Message: AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding is insecure
```

**Dataflow Path:**
```
SOURCE: "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" (hardcoded string, line 17)
  ↓
STEP 1: CIPHER_MODE assignment
  ↓
SINK: Cipher.getInstance(mode) (line 38)
```

**Validation Verdict:**
```json
{
  "source_attacker_controlled": false,
  "source_reasoning": "Hardcoded constant, requires code modification",
  "is_exploitable": false,
  "exploitability_confidence": 0.1,
  "false_positive": true,
  "false_positive_reason": "Algorithm is weak but hardcoded - not runtime exploitable"
}
```

**Result:**
- ❌ Marked as NOT EXPLOITABLE
- ✅ False positive caught
- 📊 Score: 0.1 (configuration issue, not exploitable vulnerability)

  ↓
🛡️ SANITIZER: input.replace("'", "''") (line 30)
  ↓
SINK: executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=" + id) (line 45)
```

**Validation Verdict:**
```json
{
  "source_attacker_controlled": true,
  "source_reasoning": "HTTP GET parameter, fully attacker-controlled",

  "sanitizers_effective": false,
  "sanitizer_details": [{
    "name": "input.replace(\"'\", \"''\")",

  }],

  "is_exploitable": true,
  "exploitability_confidence": 0.95,
  "attack_complexity": "low",
  "attack_payload_concept": "?id=1\" OR 1=1--",
  "cvss_estimate": 9.1
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Confirmed EXPLOITABLE
- ⚠️ Weak sanitizer identified
- 🎯 Bypass technique provided
- 📊 Score: 0.95 (high confidence exploitation)

```

**Dataflow Path:**
```
SOURCE: request.getParameter("name") (attacker-controlled, line 10)
  ↓
🛡️ SANITIZER: StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(name) (line 15)
  ↓
SINK: response.getWriter().write("<div>" + name + "</div>") (line 20)
```

**Validation Verdict:**
```json
{
  "source_attacker_controlled": true,
  "source_reasoning": "HTTP parameter, attacker-controlled",

  "sanitizers_effective": true,
  "sanitizer_details": [{
    "name": "StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4()",
    "purpose": "HTML entity encoding",
    "bypass_possible": false,
    "bypass_method": ""
  }],

  "is_exploitable": false,
  "exploitability_confidence": 0.05,
  "false_positive": true,
  "false_positive_reason": "Effective HTML encoding prevents XSS exploitation"
}
```

**Result:**
- ❌ Marked as NOT EXPLOITABLE
- ✅ Effective sanitizer confirmed
- 📊 Score: 0.05 (properly mitigated)

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Accuracy**

## How to Use

### Automatic (Recommended)

Dataflow validation runs automatically when:
1. CodeQL scan includes dataflow findings
2. LLM analysis marks finding as exploitable
3. MANTISHACK has access to an LLM

No special flags needed!

### Manual Review

Check validation results:

```bash
# View validation for specific finding
cat out/validation/{finding_id}_validation.json | jq

# Check which were false positives
cat out/autonomous/autonomous_analysis_report.json | \
  jq '.false_positives_caught'

# List all validated dataflows
cat out/autonomous/autonomous_analysis_report.json | \
  jq '.dataflow_validated'
```

## Summary

Ideally we want dataflow validation to transform MANTISHACK from a **pattern matcher** into an **intelligent security analyst** that:

✅ Understands complete attack paths
✅ Validates source control rigorously
✅ Analyzes sanitizer effectiveness
✅ Identifies bypass techniques
✅ Assesses true exploitability
✅ Catches false positives
✅ Provides detailed reasoning
✅ Saves massive review time

**The result: High-confidence, actionable vulnerability intelligence**
